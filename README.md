This Library Management System project was created as part of our Database Management Systems (DBMS) subject in college. It was a group project, aimed at demonstrating how database concepts learned in class can be applied to build a real-world application.

The primary goal was to design and implement a functional web-based system that allows management of books, students, and issue records, while showcasing core DBMS operations such as data definition, manipulation, joins, constraints, transactions, and stored procedures.

Within the team, my assigned responsibility was to develop the complete website interface and backend connectivity — ensuring that the system worked end-to-end from the frontend dashboard to the MySQL database.
I personally handled the:

Frontend development using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript

Backend API creation using Node.js and Express

Database connection and queries using MySQL

Integration and testing to make the system fully functional

I also made use of AI tools (including ChatGPT) for coding assistance, debugging, documentation, and improving overall project presentation. However, all final code integration, testing, and system functionality were completed by me manually.

This project reflects both our team collaboration and my individual technical contribution toward implementing DBMS concepts in a practical environment.
